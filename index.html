                        <b>Hello, I’m Jordan!</b> <br><br> I’m a senior studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in <b>Computational Biology</b> at the <b>University of Southern California</b>. I’m passionate about the intersection between human genetics and computer science. My interests primarily lie in genetics, fairness, and machine learning. In my free time, I love bullet journaling, playing with my cat, baking bread, and hiking! <br><br> Currently, I’m developing a reference-free machine learning method to detect <b>archaic introgression</b> using ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs).  Previously, I’ve conducted work on assessing the efficacy of genotype imputation for diverse populations. On the side, I’m reading about generating ARGs from sequencing data and leveraging deep learning to develop methods to increase equity in human genetics.                    </p>

                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-user-nurse"></i> Continious Stress Prediction for Healthcare Workers</h2>
                    <p>Healthcare workers are constantly exposed to high-stress working conditions that increase burnout rates and lower the quality of patient care. While it is vital to continuously monitor healthcare worker stress to provide necessary interventions, traditional survey methods can interfere with tasks in real-world healthcare contexts. Wearable devices offer a non-invasive way to detect worker stress continuously; however, predictions may be influenced by an individual’s activities and definitions of stress. In this project, we identified extreme graident boosting trees as a promising method for contininious stress prediction, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.83 using real-world health worker data. In addition to benchmarking continuous stress prediction, we assessed the dataset generalizability with domain adaptation. Interestingly, we found that supervised domain adaptation performs comparably to vanilla prediction methods on the target domain, suggesting the capacity to aggregate future datasets. Through this project, we highlighted numerous challenges to generalizing stress detection for health workers, including differing stress definitions and sensor types among available datasets. </p>                    <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=7og2bOAXhup" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> Imputation Around the World</h2>
                <p>By predicting unobserved genotypes based on sequenced individuals, imputation increases marker density and enables large-scale genome-wide association studies. The state-of-the-art imputation reference panel released by the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) contains a substantial number of admixed African and Hispanic/Latino samples. As a result, these populations are imputed with nearly the same efficacy as European cohorts. However, imputation for ethnic minorities primarily residing outside of North America still falls short in performance due to persisting underrepresentation. My research aims to expose quality weaknesses in the TOPMed reference panel and offer solutions to help close the quality gap of analysis between European and Non-European populations.</p>

                    <p>The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) hosts one of the largest sources of information on youth aging out of the foster care system in the United States. It covers nearly 10 years and consists of basic demographic information, outcome data, and independent living service (ILS) utilization for thousands of individuals. This report examined substance abuse referrals to analyze indicators for high-risk behavior in youth who may lack adequate support systems. We identified that having a connection to an adult and current school enrollment increases the likelihood of substance abuse referrals. This suggests that youth without strong mentorship may be at risk for not having access to substance abuse referrals. On the other hand, educational aid, public food assistance, and other public financial assistance may deter referral, meaning youth who receive these aid forms may have lower rates of substance abuse. <br> <br>This report was conducted as course work for CSCI 461: Artificial Inteligence in Sustainable Development under the guidance of Bistra Dilkina. </p>                    <a href="docs/FOSTER_JordanCahoon_ProjectFinalReport_fall2022.pdf" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Computational Agroecology</h2>
                <p>The current state of modern agriculture relies on monocultures, where a singular crop is grown in a field. This practice requires massive land clearing, destroys the local biosystems, and in the long term leads to lower yields. The alternative solution is to grow multiple crops in the same field, known as polycultures. This method is more sustainable and leverages natural symbiotic relationships to increase crop yield. Yet testing which crops are optimal to grow within the same field is extremely time consuming. My group is developing a reinforcement learning agent that systematically predicts polyculture composition and crop placement. This agent will help farmers incorporate polyculture design in their crops.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-mosquito"></i> Malaria Prediction with Weather</h2>
                <p>The mosquitos that carry the malaria parasite rely on shallow puddles of water to breed. Hence, weather factors including humidity, precipitation, and temperature, are critical to predict malaria outbreaks. While outbreak surveillance records may not be retained, weather data is consistently recorded and extremely abundant. We developed a model that utilizes climate and outbreak data to predict future outbreaks. Additionally, this model is transferrable to other regions with sparser outbreak data.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-dna"></i> Triple Liftover</h2>
                <p>Because the human genome has multiple iterations, the Liftover program is a critical tool to update genetic data to the most current version of the human genome. However, Liftover is unable to correctly detect palindromic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which destabilizes the surrounding region. Triple Liftover predicts and corrects SNVs located in inverted regions using a heuristic-based approach. Overall, my work focused on structuring the program  so the design was flexible and user friendly.</p>

                  <p>Intestinal parasitic worm (helminth) infection is one of the leading causes of morbidity in undeveloped countries yet the immune mechanisms that are key to worm expulsion are not well understood. By deeply examining genomic content of one cell, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is key to elucidating the complex pathways within Type II Inflammation, the main immune response to helminth infections. My role focused on processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data to uncover how CRTH2 is critical in positive worm outcomes in mice models.  </p>
